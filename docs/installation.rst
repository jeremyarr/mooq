Installing RabbitMQ
--------------------

Follow the installation guides `here <http://www.rabbitmq.com/download.html>`_ for installing RabbitMQ on your particular operating system. 

For linux users, since RabbitMQ is quite popular, check your distribution's package repository as there may already be a package available for download and easy install.
